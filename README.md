Room Key Front End Development Challenge
========================================

Hi there!

Here's my submission for the front-end challenge.  

I ended up using the 'live API' and created a very simple hotel search that
shows the top 3 hotels for a given location based on best price, most popular, and
most stars. Although the hotel info is from the live api - the images are
static/stand-ins so you won't see them change with each new search.

The search interface is very simple by design but does lack some key features
such as date-range, amenity preference, etc.

Thanks for checking it out!
